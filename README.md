# Quantum Mastery Journey 🚀

**Mission:**  
Transition from a foundational math level to domain-leading quantum scientist. Document daily grind, projects, and growth.

---

## 📅 Roadmap

| Phase | Focus | Duration |

| Phase 0 | Math Rehabilitation (Algebra, Calculus, Trigonometry) | 2–3 months |
| Phase 1 | Linear Algebra & Vector Spaces | 2–4 months |
| Phase 2 | Quantum Mechanics Foundations | 3–6 months |
| Phase 3 | Quantum Computing & Research | Ongoing |

## 🔍 Daily Plan

- Solve **20 problems daily** (mix: algebra, calculus, quantum basics)  
- Upload solutions to repo  
- Weekly: add small project / simulation  
- Monthly: write mini-essay / research note
