# Notes

This directory is for miscellaneous notes, summaries and observations.  As you work through courses, lectures or papers, jot down important definitions, derivations or insights here.  Organising notes by topic (e.g. `LinearAlgebra.md`, `QuantumPostulates.md`) will make it easier to revisit them later.

Feel free to add diagrams, examples or links to external resources.  Your notes should support your learning and help you recall tricky concepts.
