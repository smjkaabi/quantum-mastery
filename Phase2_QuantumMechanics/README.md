# Phase 2 â€“ Quantum Mechanics Foundations

This folder contains notes and exercises on the fundamentals of quantum mechanics.  The problems here cover wavefunctions, operators, commutators and basic quantum systems such as the particle in a box and the harmonic oscillator.  Working through these will prepare you for more advanced topics in quantum computing and quantum information.

Refer to the accompanying `Intro_Problems.md` file for a starter set of exercises.
