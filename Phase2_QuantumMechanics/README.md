# Phase 2 â€“ Quantum Mechanics Foundations

This folder provides a workspace for your journey into quantum mechanics. Instead of supplying a fixed set of questions, it offers a place to organise your own notes, definitions, derivations and practice problems as you explore topics such as wavefunctions, operators, commutators and simple quantum systems like the particle in a box and the harmonic oscillator.

Start by reading the accompanying `Intro_Problems.md` file, which explains how to create your own practice questions and record key principles. Use this directory to:

- Summarise the postulates, concepts and mathematical tools of quantum mechanics in your own words.
- Work through derivations, examples and textbook problems, adding your solutions and insights.
- Create subfolders for specific topics (e.g. spin, harmonic oscillator) or for course notes.

By actively writing notes and solving problems here, you will build a strong foundation for later studies in quantum information and quantum computing.
