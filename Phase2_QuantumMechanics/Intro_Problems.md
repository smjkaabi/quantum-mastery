# Foundations: Quantum Mechanics Basics

This document serves as a blank workspace for your journey into quantum mechanics. Rather than offering a fixed set of questions, it invites you to formulate and solve your own exercises as you explore wavefunctions, operators, commutators, expectation values and fundamental quantum systems such as the particle in a box or the harmonic oscillator.

Use this file to:

- Outline and solve problems that help you practise quantum mechanics concepts.
- Summarize key postulates, principles, and derivations in your own words.
- Record insights, derivations, and solutions as you deepen your understanding.

Feel free to structure your notes with headings, equations, code snippets, and links to textbooks or papers. Creating and working through your own problems will strengthen your grasp of quantum mechanics and prepare you for more advanced topics in quantum information and quantum computing.
