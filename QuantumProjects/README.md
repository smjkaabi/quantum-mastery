# Quantum Projects

This folder will host code projects, simulations and experiments related to quantum computing.  Each project should have its own subfolder with a descriptive name, including source code, notebooks and any data files.  Suggested project ideas include:

- Implement basic quantum algorithms (Deutschâ€“Jozsa, Grover, quantum teleportation) using Qiskit or another framework.
- Simulate quantum circuits with noise and explore error mitigation techniques.
- Reproduce results from a quantum computing paper or experiment.
- Build a simple quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol and test it under different noise models.

When you start a new project, create a subfolder and include a `README.md` explaining the goal, method and results.  Keep your code modular and documented so others can follow your work.
