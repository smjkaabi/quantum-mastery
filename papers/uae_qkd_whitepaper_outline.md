# Quantum-Secure Communications for UAE Telecoms (BB84 + Decoy States)

**Author:** Saeed Al-Kaabi  
**Purpose:** KU/TII-aligned short whitepaper showcasing a practical QKD simulation and its relevance to UAE critical comms.

## 1. Executive Summary (½ page)
- Why quantum communications now (threat of Shor, high-value infra).
- QKD vs PQC (complementary, not exclusive).
- This work: BB84 (+decoy), noise & distance model, implications for UAE.

## 2. Background (1 page)
- BB84 basics, bases & sifting, QBER.
- Decoy-state idea: detect photon-number-splitting attacks.
- Channel models: bit-flip, depolarizing; fiber attenuation (e.g., 0.2 dB/km).

## 3. Methods (1 page)
- Simulation assumptions & parameter table.
- Sifting rate, QBER definition.
- Secret key rate estimate (simplified bound).

## 4. Results (1 page)
- Plots: QBER vs noise; Secret key rate vs distance (with/without decoy).
- Discussion: practical operating regimes.

## 5. UAE Context (½–1 page)
- Integration into telecom backbone.
- OTN/DWDM coexistence note (at high level).
- Roadmap: lab pilot → field trial → hybrid QKD+PQC deployment.

## 6. Limitations & Next Steps (½ page)
- Finite-key effects, device imperfections, MDI-QKD as upgrade.

## Appendix
- Repro steps, repo links, environment details.
