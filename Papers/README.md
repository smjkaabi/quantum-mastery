# Papers

This directory is reserved for longer research notes, project reports, or draft papers. When you undertake a research project or want to document an experiment in detail, create a subdirectory here and place your Markdown, PDF or code.

For example, create a directory such as `MyFirstPaper/` and add your writeâ€‘up and data there. Include outlines, summaries and key insights so you can track your progress and share your findings with others.
