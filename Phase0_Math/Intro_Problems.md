# Foundations Problem Set – Algebra & Calculus

This set of problems will help you review the algebra and calculus fundamentals that underpin the rest of your quantum journey.  Work through each problem carefully—solve them by hand first, then check with a computer if you need to.

## Algebra

1. **Linear equation:** Solve for \(x\) in the equation
   \[3x + 5 = 2x - 7\].

2. **Quadratic equation:** Find the roots of the quadratic equation
   \[x^2 - 4x - 5 = 0\].

3. **System of equations:** Solve for \(x\) and \(y\):
   \[
   \begin{cases}
   2x + y = 7 \\
   x - 3y = -2
   \end{cases}
   \].

4. **Polynomial factoring:** Factor completely
   \[2x^3 - 8x^2 + 6x\].

5. **Rational expressions:** Simplify
   \[\frac{x^2 - 9}{x^2 - 6x + 9}\].

## Calculus

6. **Limits:** Evaluate the limit
   \[\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin x}{x}\].

7. **Derivatives:** Find \(\frac{d}{dx}\big(3x^4 - 2x^2 + 7\big)\).

8. **Product rule:** Differentiate \(f(x) = x^2\, \ln(x)\).

9. **Chain rule:** Differentiate \(g(x) = e^{3x^2 + 2x}\).

10. **Implicit differentiation:** Given \(x^2 + y^2 = 25\), find \(\frac{dy}{dx}\) in terms of \(x\) and \(y\).

## Mixed Practice

11. **Exponential decay:** A radioactive sample decays according to \(N(t) = N_0 e^{-\lambda t}\).  Show that its half‑life \(t_{1/2}\) satisfies \(t_{1/2} = \frac{\ln 2}{\lambda}\).

12. **Complex numbers:** Let \(z = 3 + 4i\).  Compute \(|z|\) and the complex conjugate of \(z\).

13. **Trigonometric identities:** Use Euler’s formula \(e^{i\theta} = \cos \theta + i \sin \theta\) to prove \(\cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta = 1\).

14. **Definite integral:** Evaluate
   \[\int_{0}^{1} x e^{x} \, dx\].

15. **Partial fractions:** Decompose
   \[\frac{5x}{(x-1)(x+2)}\]
   into partial fractions.

16. **Series:** Determine whether the series \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^2}\) converges or diverges.

17. **Probability:** A fair six‑sided die is rolled once.  What is the probability that the outcome is an even number?

18. **Vector addition:** Given \(\mathbf{a} = (2, -1, 3)\) and \(\mathbf{b} = (0, 4, -2)\), compute \(\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b}\).

19. **Dot product:** Compute the dot product \(\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}\) for the vectors above.

20. **Eigenvalues:** For the matrix
   \[
   A = \begin{pmatrix}
   2 & 1 \\
   1 & 2
   \end{pmatrix},
   \]
   find its eigenvalues.
