## Linear Algebra Foundations

This directory provides a space to study and practice linear algebra concepts. Rather than supplying a fixed set of exercises, it offers resources and guidance for you to create your own problems, summaries and solutions as you explore topics like vectors, matrices, determinants and eigenvalues.

Use the accompanying `Intro_Problems.md` file to learn how to structure your practice: summarise definitions and theorems, work through examples from lectures or textbooks, and record your own problems and solutions. Keep all your notes and insights in this folder so you can revisit them later.
