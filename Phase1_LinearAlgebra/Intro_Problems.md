# Foundations: Linear Algebra & Vector Spaces

This document is a blank canvas for your linear algebra practice. Rather than providing prewritten exercises, it is meant for **you** to create and solve your own problems as you study topics like row reduction, rank, inverses, eigenvalues, determinants, and basis vectors.

Use this file to:

- Write out problem statements and work through solutions step by step.
- Summarize key concepts, formulas, and theorems in your own words.
- Keep track of insights or tricky points you encounter while studying.

Feel free to format your notes with headings, bullet points, or even include links to external resources. Building your own problem sets and solutions will deepen your understanding and prepare you for more advanced quantum mechanics and quantum computing topics.
